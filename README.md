# Vector Gazer

Live demo: https://jeyabbalas.github.io/vector-gazer/

Vector Gazer is a tool for visualizing OpenAI API embeddings. It enables you to generate embeddings from text by calling the embeddings API for you. It allows you to project and visualize these embeddings in a 2D or 3D space. The tool also has a feature to test queries that are dynamically embedded and projected into this space.

There are several use-cases of this tool including: prompt engineering, building semantic search tools, building Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, and designing agents (OpenAPI specifications can be embedded instead of plain text).
